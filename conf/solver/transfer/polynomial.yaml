# Polynomial-based transfer operators
# Uses Chebyshev polynomial fitting and evaluation
name: polynomial

# Prolongation: coarse -> fine interpolation
prolongation:
  method: polynomial  # Uses chebfit/chebval for Chebyshev interpolation

# Restriction: fine -> coarse interpolation (for residuals in VMG/FMG)
restriction:
  method: injection  # Direct injection (coarse nodes are subset of fine nodes)
