# FFT/DCT-based transfer operators (Zhang & Xi 2010 paper method)
# Uses Discrete Cosine Transform for spectral interpolation
name: fft

# Prolongation: coarse -> fine interpolation
prolongation:
  method: fft  # Uses DCT coefficients, zero-padding, and inverse DCT

# Restriction: fine -> coarse interpolation (for residuals in VMG/FMG)
restriction:
  method: fft  # Uses DCT, truncate high frequencies, inverse DCT
