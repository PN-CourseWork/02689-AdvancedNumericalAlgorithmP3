# Botella & Peyret (1998) - Benchmark spectral solution for lid-driven cavity
# Reference: J. Comp. Phys. 179, 439-468 (2002) - Tables VIII and IX
# Primary and secondary vortex characteristics at Re=1000 with regularized lid velocity
# N=160 polynomial order (highest resolution benchmark)
#
# Primary vortex (PV): global minimum of streamfunction
# BR (bottom-right): secondary vortex in bottom-right corner
# BL (bottom-left): secondary vortex in bottom-left corner
# TL (top-left): secondary vortex in top-left corner (absent at Re=1000)
