# Botella & Peyret (1998) - Benchmark spectral solution for lid-driven cavity
# Reference: J. Comp. Phys. 179, 439-468 (2002) - Table II
# Primary and secondary vortex characteristics at Re=100 with regularized lid velocity
# N=128 polynomial order
#
# Primary vortex (PV): global minimum of streamfunction
# BR (bottom-right): secondary vortex in bottom-right corner
# BL (bottom-left): secondary vortex in bottom-left corner (very weak at Re=100)
